1,2,1511,5,2023-9-3,Whole Year,5,3,3,4,3,3,5,2,5,2,The lake view makes up for the noise from the Steps... Noise is worst Friday/Saturday nights but better if window is kept closed.,1,2023-11-08 15:30:00

3,1,1014,5,2023-9-3,Whole Year,5,4,4,2,3,5,3,5,5,2,loving this room so far! gorgeous view at sunset time. But have really bad stink bug/fly problem.,1,2023-11-09 08:22:38
4,4,1015,5,2023-9-3,Whole Year,4,4,3,5,4,4,2,4,3,3,pretty decent single! bigger than my munger 3rd Single last year but the only complaint I have is that the window is pretty small (I like getting lots of sunlight in my room and being to see the outside but it might not be an issue for you.) The room is also slightly tilted -- the window side is farther from the ground than the door side. The rooms on Pom 5th are also not very sound-proof--I'm very sensitive to noise and I can usually hear everything in the bathroom (my room is right across from the bathroom). Overall a nice room given the privacy you'd get at Pom 5th.,0,2023-11-12 1:20:29
